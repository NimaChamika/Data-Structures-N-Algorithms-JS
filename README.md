#### 1 - Linear Search

- Simplest method for searching.
- This method can be performed on a sorted or an unsorted list.
- When data is unsorted, a linear search algorithm is preferred.
- Time complexity: O(N)

#### 2 - Binary Search

- List need to be sorted.
- Repeatedly divide the list into parts and check for the element.
- Time Complexity: O(log n)
